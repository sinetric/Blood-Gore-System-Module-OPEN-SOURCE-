blood everywhere...

You don't have to credit me, but I'd appreciate it if you give me one. Project started 19th of April 2021.

I've tried my best to abide to the Roblox Terms Of Service, if this module is somehow not following the Roblox ToS, then i apologize for my mistake and I will try my best to fix/remove this module until it is deemed appropriate for Roblox.
Please do not disable the "blood turn on/off" feature (unless you're making a new one), I've made this feature simply to abide the rules and ToS of Roblox.
If your game has console (Xbox) support, then I wouldn't recommend you to use this module (Roblox prohibits the usage of blood effects on games that support console players)

Thanks in advance, I hope you enjoy the module.
